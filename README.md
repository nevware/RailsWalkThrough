# RailsWalkThrough

Walking through building a Rails app from scratch.

This walkthrough runs through setting up a new Rails app, using Docker and docker-compose, applying bootstrap themes, setting up deployment to Heroku, and then building a timecard app.

##Setting up the dependencies.
We're going to be using Docker and docker-compose to run our development environment. This makes it _much_ easier to make sure that what runs on my machine also runs on yours. And that we can manage our development, test and production environments.

So, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/#server) on your development machine first, and then [setup docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
